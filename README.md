## Deploying
Inside the deploy directory you'll find the scripts for all of the diamond contract facets and the 3 main diamond contracts used by the RAIR system:  

| Contract | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Factory | In charge of deploying the ERC721 diamonds |
| Marketplace | Minting and resale offers |
| Facet Source | Diamond contract from which all ERC721 contracts get their facets |

The deployment process is automated, the deployment is done thanks to hardhat-deploy and the verification is done through hardhat-etherscan.  All deployed contracts can be found in the "deployments" directory
